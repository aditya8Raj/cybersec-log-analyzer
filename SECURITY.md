# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Log Analyzer Tool is designed for cybersecurity professionals, and we take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly.

### üîí How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to the project maintainer (include "SECURITY" in subject line)
2. **Private GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Encrypted Communication**: If needed, request PGP key for sensitive disclosures

### üìù What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., code injection, path traversal, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact assessment** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have ideas)

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Confirmation**: Within 1 week of initial response
- **Fix Development**: Depends on complexity, typically 1-4 weeks
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and tested

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Scope

#### In Scope

- **Code Injection**: Through log parsing or file operations
- **Path Traversal**: Via file path parameters
- **Denial of Service**: Through malformed log inputs
- **Information Disclosure**: Exposure of sensitive system information
- **Input Validation**: Bypass of security checks
- **Regex DoS**: Catastrophic backtracking in patterns

#### Out of Scope

- **Social Engineering**: Attacks on users rather than the software
- **Physical Access**: Vulnerabilities requiring local machine access
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Issues in Python standard library
- **Misconfiguration**: User errors in deployment
- **Rate Limiting**: DoS through legitimate high-volume usage

### üîç Known Security Considerations

The tool has been designed with these security principles:

#### Input Validation

- All IP addresses are validated using regex and range checks
- File paths are checked for existence and permissions
- Log entries are processed safely without code execution

#### Safe Processing

- No use of `eval()`, `exec()`, or similar dangerous functions
- Regex patterns designed to prevent catastrophic backtracking
- Memory usage considered for large file processing

#### Error Handling

- Errors don't expose sensitive system information
- Graceful degradation for malformed inputs
- Logging doesn't include sensitive data

### üö® Critical Vulnerabilities

If you find any of these types of vulnerabilities, please report immediately:

1. **Remote Code Execution** (RCE)
2. **SQL Injection** (if database features are added)
3. **Path Traversal** leading to file system access
4. **Privilege Escalation**
5. **Authentication Bypass** (if auth features are added)

### üèÜ Security Researcher Recognition

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:

- **Credited** in the security advisory (unless anonymity is requested)
- **Listed** in the project's security acknowledgments
- **Thanked** publicly after the issue is resolved
- **Consulted** on the fix implementation (if desired)

### üìã Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Yes    |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå No     |

### üîß Security Best Practices for Users

#### File Permissions

```bash
# Ensure log files have appropriate permissions
chmod 640 /var/log/auth.log
chown root:adm /var/log/auth.log
```

#### Safe Usage

```bash
# Run with minimal privileges
python analyzer.py /path/to/logs/auth.log

# Use absolute paths to prevent confusion
python analyzer.py /var/log/auth.log --export csv

# Validate output file paths
python analyzer.py logs/auth.log --output /safe/path/report.json
```

#### Environment Security

- Run in isolated environments when analyzing untrusted logs
- Regularly update Python and system packages
- Monitor resource usage when processing large files
- Use read-only access for log files when possible

### üîÑ Regular Security Reviews

The project undergoes regular security reviews:

- **Code Review**: All contributions are reviewed for security issues
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning when available
- **Penetration Testing**: Periodic security assessments
