2. Make your changes following the coding standards below
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Update documentation if needed
6. Commit your changes with clear commit messages
7. Push to your fork and create a pull request

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Security Considerations
- Validate all inputs, especially IP addresses and file paths
- Use secure regex patterns that don't introduce vulnerabilities
- Handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information
- Test with malicious or malformed log entries
- Consider performance with large log files

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure tests are deterministic and reliable
- Use meaningful test names and descriptions
- Maintain test coverage

### Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add examples for new command-line options
- Update help text and usage information
- Include security considerations for new features

## üîí Security Focus Areas

When contributing, prioritize these security aspects:

### Detection Accuracy
- Minimize false positives in threat detection
- Ensure regex patterns are precise and efficient
- Test against various log formats and edge cases

### Performance
- Optimize for large log file processing
- Consider memory usage with massive datasets
- Profile code for bottlenecks

### Reliability
- Handle malformed log entries gracefully
- Implement robust error handling
- Validate file permissions and access

### Extensibility
- Design modular code for easy pattern additions
- Use configuration files for customizable settings
- Support multiple log formats where possible

## üéØ Contribution Ideas

### High Priority
- Support for additional log formats (Apache, Nginx, Windows Event Logs)
- Geographic IP analysis and visualization
- Time-based attack pattern detection
- Integration with threat intelligence APIs
- Real-time log monitoring capabilities

### Medium Priority
- Web dashboard using Streamlit or Flask
- Database storage for historical analysis
- Email/Slack notifications for critical threats
- Configuration file support
- Docker containerization

### Low Priority
- GUI application using tkinter or PyQt
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Log correlation across multiple sources
- Custom rule engine for detection patterns
